            <h1>Ford Shelby GT350R Mustang</h1>
           
            
            <p class="mBody">
                <a>It</a> was December 2013 when Ford

                unveiled the highly-anticipated 2015 Mustang. The redesigned pony arrived with massive improvements over its predecessor, including an independent rear suspension,
                a revised interior, retuned engines and a brand-new 2.3-liter, EcoBoost four-banger. Less than a year has passed since then, and the sixth-generation Mustang
                received a much-needed high-performance version to replace last year's Shelby-badged model. With the ink still wet on our 2016 Shelby GT350 review, the Blue Oval 
                has yet another muscle car in the pipeline under the GT350R nameplate.<br /><br /> As you might have already guessed, the "R" at the end of the iconic name makes this Shelby the lightest, 
                quickest and meanest Mustang yet, with a host of track-honed talents on top. 
                If you missed the Mustang 302 Boss over the past couple of years, the GT350R is here not just to replace it, but take over from where Ford left it back in 2013 and 
                open a brand-new chapter in this pony's rich heritage.
                In short, you're about to learn more about the most track-focused Mustang in history and Ford's answer to the bonkers Camaro Z/28
                .<br />

                <li>It's Ford's most powerful naturally aspirated engine ever and revs to 8000-plus-rpm.</li>
                <li>Coyote foundation, but not a parts-bin build.</li>
                <li>It's lighter than the Coyote 5.0-liter.</li>
                <li>It'll kind of bolt right in to your 2015 Mustang GT.</li>

        <h3>&#8661; FORD MUSTANG SHELBY GT350R EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR </h3>
        <div>
            <p id="a2">
                Unlike the standard Mustang GT350 2017, the GT350R exterior is optimized for extra performance. To start with,
                the vehicle has received a redesigned front splitter as well as a huge carbon-fiber rear wing which help improve <br> its down-force.
                The rear wing helps enhance the balance between down-force and lift. On the sides, you will certainly notice its red brake
                calipers which come in handy when bringing the monster to a halt.

                <i>''Great handling car,well thought out - built tough. This car is a dream for those 1960's shelby fanatics. 
                It is more car then I will ever use,and it is forgiving. I loved my 2013 boss but this car is a lot more. 
                I have a tech version and I am happy with it. It is amazing around town and highway...easy to drive.
                I drive it in the old mans mode all of the time and I am not bored. Gas consumption is not the reason 
                to buy this car for that I have a Prias that I like two.''<br />

                <i>''This car is perfect for me. However, there are some exterior quality control issues. In my case, 
                the adhesive holding the right front wheel vent cover is missing a piece of the adhesive. 
                Others have reported misalignment of body panels, but no such issue in my car. When I had the car detailed, 
                the detailer noticed a large black screw under the driver's seat, and couldn't determine where it came from. 
                Aside from this, the car is simply awesome - the exhaust note is pure music. That most dealers are charging over 
                MSRP is pretty sad, but I paid a few thousand over MSRP and still think it's worth it. If I had to pay 10k or more 
                over MSRP, then no. The 2017 models are just starting to come out now and kind of wish I'd held out, as the track 
                pack comes standard with these 2017s. But still, very happy with the vehicle.''<br />

                    ''been driving a tech package car for 4 months with no regrets. Paid 4K over MSRP but picked up in 1 week and 
                    feel like I stole it now! Planned on a 911 as my mid life crises car until I saw this one, and it may well be 
                    the better machine. Very easy to drive daily, addictive exhaust sound, excellent trans, brakes and interior, 
                    and the only downside to this car(reaching here) is the 15 MPG I average in city diving. I am sure 16-18 would 
                    be possible with short shifts and restraint, but I would need earplugs and maturity, which is not realistic for me. 
                    Ford dealer was fantastic, 200 miles away, and honest enuff to get me back. Great experience and car is cutting edge 
                    perf at a bargain price. No tickets yet!''<br />
